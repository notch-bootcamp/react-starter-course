# 01 React Fundamentals: Initial Setup

This repository is intended to follow along the React Fundamentals lecture series.

Please make sure to do the following:
1. Install Node.js ([link](https://nodejs.org/en)) - The lecture uses v18.16.0 (LTS at time of recording), but any version should be fine
2. Run `npm install`
3. (Optional) If using Visual Studio Code, installing the ESLint extension ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)) is advised.

To start the app just run `npm run dev`
